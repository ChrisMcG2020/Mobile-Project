The app overview is as follows: The app is provisionally named HereIam,
and it is intended that it is the opening app on all company sales representatives’ tablets and smartphones.
The app will open with the company logo overlaid on a map of the user’s current location.
Specifically, it should be a map of the current city.
The display should also show the current time and UTC time London (or GMT). 
As a professional touch, it is required that the screen can be cleared, simply by shaking the phone or tablet.
The app should clear back to a screen advertising TechMob‘s business.
